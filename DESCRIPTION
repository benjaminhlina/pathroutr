Description: The `pathroutr` package aims to provide a set of tools for routing marine
    animal tracks around land barriers based on the shortest path through a visibility
    graph network. The foundation of the package is a graph network created from a 
    Delaunay Triangle mesh created from the vertices of land polygons within the study 
    area. Any network edges that cross or fall completely within the land (barrier)
    polygons are removed.
