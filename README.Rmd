The goal of `{pathroutr}` is to provide functions for re-routing paths that cross land
around barrier polygons. The use case in mind is movement paths derived from location
estimates of marine animals. Due to error associated with these locations it is
not uncommon for these tracks to cross land. The `{pathroutr}` package aims to provide
a pragmatic and fast solution for re-routing these paths around land and along an
efficient path. It is important to note any re-routed paths are not statistical models
and may have unintended consequences and biases associated with them that depends on the
study animal, study area, and error nature of the original data. Re-routed paths may
also exceed the speed or physiological capabilities of the study species. 

## Credit Where Credit is Due

We believe this is the first implementation of visibility graphs within R for spatial
routing. However, three sources were of key importance to developing the approach

1. Seaway distances with PostgreSQL by Angus Cameron (24 Apr, 2016)
2. Pyvisgraph Python package by Christian Reksten-Monsen
3. Jan, Gene Eu, et al. "An $\bm {O (n\log n)} $ Shortest Path Algorithm Based on Delaunay Triangulation." IEEE/ASME Transactions On Mechatronics 19.2 (2013): 660-666. DOI: 10.1109/TMECH.2013.2252076

In addition, both the `{sf}` and `{stplanr}` R packages are of key importance to the 
functionality within `{pathroutr}`

## Installation

`{pathroutr}` is currently not available on CRAN and also requires R >= 4.0. Please 
upgrade your version of R, if needed, before proceeding. Future versions of 
`{pathroutr}` may support pre-4.0 versions of R. But, for now, only 4.0+ is supported.

The development version  of `{pathroutr}` is available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jmlondon/pathroutr) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jmlondon/pathroutr")
```

## Package Dependencies

`{pathroutr}` is highly dependent upon the `{stplanr}` and `{sf}` packages. The required
version of `{stplanr}` is 0.8.0.9000 or greater. The current (as of 2020-12-10) version
available on CRAN is 0.8.0. So, `{stplanr}` will need to be installed from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/stplanr")
```

Also, note that the minimum supported version of `{sf}` is 0.9. So, this might also be a
good time to check and update your `{sf}` package versions.

Core packages from the `tidyverse` (`{dplyr}`, `{purrr}`, and `{tibble}`) are also
required.
